## 3. Workspace Creation & Configuration
Once the slack app is installed, navigate to the selected Slack workspace and add Dosu to a channel by messing `@Dosu` to the channel.

You'll be asked to add Dosu to the channel and then you'll see the message below

Currently, the only aspect of the Slack workspace to configure is which data sources the workspace should use. 
You'll be prompted to select a data source after you select "Create Workspace" above

## 5. Usage
Once you save above, Dosu is ready to go! Message `@Dosu` in a channel message or within a thread to get answers and information from Dosu.
