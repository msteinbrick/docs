A **data source** is a source of information that Dosu has access to in a workspace.

<Note>
In many cases, a repository workspace has only a single data source which is the repository itself.
</Note>

A workspaces can have multiple data sources, and Dosu uses the information provided through data sources to build a knowledge base for the workspace.

In the app, visit the [Data Sources page](https://app.dosu.dev/data-sources) to view your organization's data sources or create new data sources.
