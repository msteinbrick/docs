# What are response previews?
Previews allow you to observe Dosu's commenting behavior without user facing impact.

This feature was developed along side maintainers who were excited about Dosu, but wanted more
information before making a decision to allow it to respond to users. With these previews, you can see what Dosu *would have commented* on a new issue if commenting had been enabled.

# Configuration Settings
You'll be able to see Dosu previews as long as Dosu isn't configured to reply to new threads. 

Specifically, this means "Comment Similar Issues" must be disabled and issue commenting must be disabled or set to 
automatically reply to **No One**. 

For more information, see the [GitHub Workspace Configuration](/pages/github-configuration) page.


# Previews
Given the correct configuration, Dosu previews will appear on the [Threads page](https://app.dosu.dev/threads/).

Selecting on a given issue or discussion on the left hand column will pull up the corresponding thread. Each message of the 
thread will be displayed and the Dosu preview will be included with the "Preview" badge you see above.
