title: "Issue Triage +  Q&A"
---

Technical investigations encompass a large part of engineering time at any size organization.

At Dosu, our flagship feature is built to allow users of varying expertise to do deeper technical investigations in less time
-- saving engineering time and keeping users unblocked.

## Approach
At a high level, Dosu's core logic consists of a **knowledge base** and an **agent**.

The **knowledge base** includes primary and derived documents collected from a set of [Data Sources](/pages/concepts-data-sources) which are purpose built to serve a number of **agent** workflows that are eventually synthesized into a final response.
 

## Usage
Currently, Dosu's issue triage and Q&A feature are available in GitHub Issues, GitHub Discussions, and Slack channels.
To see live examples this Dosu feature in action, you can view a number of OSS repositories with Dosu enabled on new issues and discussions:
- https://github.com/run-llama/llama_index/discussions
- https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchainjs/issues
- https://github.com/apache/superset/issues

For more information on how to configure Dosu for issue triage and Q&A, see the [Repository Workspace Creation](/pages/workspace-creation-github-repository) or [Slack Channel Creation](/pages/workspace-creation-slack-channel) documentation.
