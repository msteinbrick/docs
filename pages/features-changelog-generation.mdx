title: 'Changelog Generation' 
---

Writing changelogs is a time consuming but important aspect of managing a codebase.

<Note>
Changelog generation is currently in private-beta, please reach out to hi@dosu.dev for access.
</Note>


We've create a process to automate changelog generation in a variety of contexts which saves time for teams and 
allows them to more easily communicate their work.

## Approach
For a given time range and context, Dosu will gather information from a variety of sources and intelligently curate the important changes 
for the specific context. These changes are synthesized into a changelog which can be published in a number of ways.

## Usage
Dosu's changelog feature is currently in beta, but you can view examples auto-generated Dosu changelogs for Apache Superset which have been shared with their community
