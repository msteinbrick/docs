A **data source** is a source of information that Dosu has access to. A workspaces can have one or more data sources.

<Note>
In many cases, a repository workspace has only a single data source which is the repository itself.
</Note>

Each data source will be indexed and integrated into Dosu's knowledge for the workspace, and Dosu will look through this knowledge when running actions.
Currently, a data source can be a GitHub repository or website.

In the app, see the [Data Sources page](https://app.dosu.dev/data-sources) to view all your oranization's data sources:
