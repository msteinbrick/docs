A **workspace** defines an instance of Dosu. Each workspace consists of:
    1. A **target** which determines *where* Dosu will act.
    2. One or more **data sources** which determine *what information* Dosu can access.
    2. A **configuration** which deteremines *how* Dosu will act.

Any action Dosu takes has a corresponding workspace behind it. 
Currently, the target a workspace can have is either a GitHub repository or a Slack channel.

In the app, see the [Workspaces Page](https://app.dosu.dev/workspaces) to view your oranization's workspaces
