A **workspace** defines an instance of Dosu. Each workspace consists of:
    1. A **target** which determines *where* Dosu will act.
    2. **Data sources** which determine *what information* Dosu has access to.
    2. A **configuration** which deteremines *how* Dosu will act.

Any action Dosu takes has a corresponding workspace behind it. 
Currently, a workspace's target can be a GitHub repository or Slack channel.

In the app, see the [Workspaces Page](https://app.dosu.dev/workspaces) to view your oranization's workspaces
