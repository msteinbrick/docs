title: "Auto-Labeling"
---

Labeling is a key aspect of any task managment or ticketing platform.

We've invested a lot into auto-labeling at Dosu because it's a time saver for maintainers, it keeps projcets organized, and it enables Dosu to be better in everything else it does.

## Approach
Dosu's auto-labeling system works by using the context of the available labels and the past labeling activity to determine which
labels are relevant to a newly created entity whether that be an issue, pull request, or ticket.


## Usage
Currently, Dosu supports auto-labeling for GitHub issues and pull requests. See the links below for live examples of Dosu auto-labeling:
- https://github.com/apache/superset/issues
- https://github.com/apache/airflow/issues
- https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchain/pulls
- https://github.com/langgenius/dify/pulls

For more information on how to configure auto-labeling for GitHub, see the [Repository Workspace Creation](/docs/workspace-creation-github-repository) page.
