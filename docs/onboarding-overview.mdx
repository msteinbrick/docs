## What is Dosu?
<img width="500" noZoom src="/images/hero.png" />

Dosu is an AI teammate for OSS projects and engineering teams. Dosu started from our own team's experience in OSS maintainence and it's intial feature set was built specifically for OSS maintainers.

We know first hand the difficulties of maintaining open source projects, and we wanted to build something to keep GitHub repositories organized and help users stay unblocked.


## What can Dosu do?
For a full list of current features, see the [Features](/docs/features) section of our documentation. 
Ultimately, we're building Dosu to help with all the engineering knowledge work that happens outside the IDE -- so developers can focus more on building great products.

## How can I use Dosu?
Dosu can currently be used as a GitHub or Slack app, and we'll be rolling out more integrations soon. To start, continue on to the [Quick Start](/docs/quickstart) and [Configuration](/docs/configuration) pages.
