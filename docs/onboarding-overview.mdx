## What is Dosu?
<img width="650" noZoom src="/images/hero.png" />

Dosu is an AI teammate for OSS projects and engineering teams. 

Dosu started from our team's experience in OSS and its intial feature set was built specifically for maintainers. 
We know first hand the difficulties of maintaining open source projects, and we wanted to build a product to keep repositories organized and users unblocked.

## What can Dosu do?
We're building Dosu to help with all the engineering knowledge work that happens outside the IDE so developers can focus more on doing what they love -- building great products.

For a full list of current features, see the [Features](/docs/features-auto-labeling) section of our documentation.


## How can I use Dosu?
Dosu can be used within GitHub or Slack, and we'll be rolling out more integrations soon. 

To get started, continue on to the [Quick Start](/docs/onboarding-quickstart) and [Key Concepts](/docs/onboarding-key-concepts) pages.
