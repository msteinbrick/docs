title: "Issue Triage +  Q&A"
---

Technical investigations encompass a large part of engineering time at any size organization.

At Dosu, our flagship feature is built to allow users of varying expertise to do deeper technical investigeations in less time
-- saving engineering time and keeping users unblocked.

## Approach
At a high level, Dosu's core logic is comprised of a **knowledge base** and an **agent**.

The **knowledge base** is comprised of primary and derived documents collected from a set of [Data Sources](/docs/concepts-data-sources) which are purpose built to serve a number of **agent** workflows that are eventually synthesized into a final response.
 

## Usage
Currently, Dosu's issue triage and Q&A feature are available in GitHub Issues, GitHub Discussions, and Slack channels.
To see live examples this Dosu feature in action, you can view a number of OSS repositories with Dosu enabled on new issues and disucssions:
