## Terminology

Much of the difficulty in understanding a new tool is getting familiar with its terminology! 
Here, you'll find definitions for some of the core terms you'll see used throughout our documentation.

  <Tab title='Workspace'>
    A **workspace** defines an instance of Dosu. Each workspace consists of:
      1. A **target** which determines *where* Dosu will act.
      2. One or more **data sources** which determine *what information* Dosu can access.
      2. A **configuration** which deteremines *how* Dosu will act.

    Any action Dosu takes has a corresponding workspace behind it. 
    Currently, the target a workspace can have is either a GitHub repository or a Slack channel.
    
    In the app, see the [Workspaces page](https://app.dosu.dev/workspaces) to view all your oranization's workspaces:

  </Tab>
  <Tab title='Data Source'>
    A **data source** is a source of information that Dosu has access to. A workspaces can have a single data source or a collection of data sources.

    <Note>
    In many cases, a repository workspace has a single data source which is the repository itself.
    </Note>

    Each data source will be indexed and integrated into Dosu's knowledge for the workspace, and Dosu will look through this knowledge when running actions.
    Currently, a data source can be a GitHub repositorie or website.
