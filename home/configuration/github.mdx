        - If the author responds that the issue is relevant, Dosu will loop in a maintainer
        - If the author responds that is issue is no longer relevant, Dosu will close the issue

    - This setting is popular in many open-source repositories because it removes friction for users to upvote issues that are relevant to them
- PR Labels [Pull Requests]
    - **Add LGTM labels**: if enabled, Dosu will add a ‚ÄúLGTM‚Äù label if the PR is approved by a maintainer. This is a feature used widely by the Kubernetes ecosystem
    - **Add size labels:** if enabled, Dosu will add a ‚Äúsize‚Äù label to each open PR, giving a quick indication of the size of the change (size:S, size:M, size:XL, etc)
