## Signing Up
Currently, you’ll need authenticate with your [GitHub](https://github.com/) account to sign up for Dosu.

## Waitlist
Due to high request volume Dosu access is currently waitlisted. We want to work closely with our early users to ensure a high quality experience.

If you’d like to be taken off the waitlist sooner, we’d [love to meet with you](https://cal.com/team/dosu-partners/intro-call)!

## Workspace Setup

Follow the steps on the left hand side of the workspace flow to get your workspace set up

<Info>
See [“Dosu Configuration”](home/configuration) for more details on the **Configure** step
</Info>

Keep in mind, a Dosu workspace will not take any actions until it’s activated, and you’ll explicitly have to activate a workspace after you’ve created it.
You’ll only be able to activate a workspace after it’s data sources have been indexed

## Indexing
After workspace set up, it may take some time for Dosu to index selected data sources. You'll only be able to activate a workspace after it’s data sources have been indexed

<Warning>Indexing may up to a few hours for larger repositories</Warning>

## Terminology

### Workspace
A workspace represents a specific instance of Dosu that acts on a target, and a *target* is the place Dosu will interact with end users (GitHub repository, Slack channel). Each workspace has its own configuration.

### Data Sources
Data sources are the sources of information a Dosu workspace has access to. Each workspace will have it’s own set of data sources configured
