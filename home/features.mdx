title: 'Features'
---

Dosu’s initial feature set was built specifically for OSS maintainers. Our team knows first hand the difficulties of maintaining open source projects, and we wanted to build something to keep GitHub repositories organized and help users stay unblocked.

## Auto Reply

* Dosu gives a first pass at replying to new issues and discussions
    * You can also summon Dosu into an ongoing by mentioning it, “@dosu-bot”
* Dosu tries to find any information related to the user’s questions to generate a helpful answer
    * “Related information” could include existing issues or discussions, code changes, or docs
* If Dosu can't find relevant information, it'll ask for more details.
* Dosu will get better overtime (more answered questions = better knowledge).
    * If you see a response from Dosu that is useful, make sure to give the response a 👍
    * Similarly, if Dosu is incorrect or not helpful, give it a 👎 to let it know

## Auto Labelling
* Labeling is one of the primary ways repositories stay organized
* Dosu is able to intelligently auto*label new issues and PRs
* If corrected, Dosu learns which labels apply in which contexts
<Tip>
Dosu learns from corrections! Add labels Dosu misses or remove incorrect labels to teach it the nuances of your repository
</Tip>

## Smarter Stale Bot

* A growing backlog of stale issues (or important issues that haven’t been addressed) are a major pain point for a lot of OSS projects
* Dosu provides a “smarter”, configurable stale bot to deal with these longstanding issues

These are only some of the features Dosu provides for OSS repositories. For a more comprehensive list see the “Dosu Configuration” section below.
